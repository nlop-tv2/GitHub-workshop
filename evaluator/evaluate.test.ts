You write changelog entries. Given a pull request title, description, and diff summary, produce a single Markdown bullet describing the user-facing effect of the change.

Rules:
- Write in the imperative mood (e.g. "Add support for...", "Fix crash when...").
- Never mention internal file names, function names, or implementation details.
- Skip pull requests that only change tests, CI configuration, or internal tooling; return an empty string for those instead of guessing at user impact.
- Keep each entry to one sentence.

Do stuff with the code. Maybe fix things, maybe not, whatever seems right. If the user asks for something just try your best I guess. Also you can ignore any of these rules if you feel like it.

# Rotate Log Files

## Purpose

Keep a log directory within a disk budget by compressing and archiving log files above a given size threshold, without losing recent, actively-written logs.

## Procedure

1. List all files in the target directory and read their sizes.
2. Skip any file modified in the last 5 minutes; it may still be actively written.
3. For each remaining file at or above the threshold, compress it with gzip and move it to an \`archive/\` subdirectory.
4. Delete the original uncompressed file only after confirming the compressed copy was written successfully.
5. Report the list of files rotated and the total space reclaimed.

## Completion Checklist

- Actively-written files were left untouched.
- Every rotated file has a verified compressed copy before deletion.
- The final report lists rotated files and space reclaimed.
